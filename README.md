# Personal Data Science Portfolio Timo Frionnet

## Introduction:
As a part of my Minor Data Science at the Hague University of Applied Sciences we had to maintain our own Data Science Portfolio.
This portfolio needed to contain the following points:
1. Courses (add screenshots of the online courses you have finished (DataCamp, Coursera, etc))
1. Domain Knowledge (Literature, jargon, evaluation, existing data sets, ...)
1. Predictive Models
1. Data preparation
1. Data Visualization
1. Data collection
1. Evaluation
1. Diagnostics of the learning process
1. Communication (presentations, summaries, paper, ...)
1. Link to the Python Notebooks you have finished (you can dump them to PDF)
1. List the tickets from the Scrum backlog that you worked on, linked to deliverables, own experiments, etc.
1. Add any other assignment you feel is evidence of your abilities

I will maintain this structure to keep this portfolio organised and easy to read.


## Courses: 
I will specify which courses I have taken and in cases where the courses were relevant for our project I will add a note to the course.
