# Personal Data Science Portfolio Timo Frionnet

## Introduction:
As a part of my Minor Data Science at the Hague University of Applied Sciences we had to maintain our own Data Science Portfolio.
This portfolio needed to contain the following points:
1. Courses (add screenshots of the online courses you have finished (DataCamp, Coursera, etc))
1. Domain Knowledge (Literature, jargon, evaluation, existing data sets, ...)
1. Predictive Models
1. Data preparation
1. Data Visualization
1. Data collection
1. Evaluation
1. Diagnostics of the learning process
1. Communication (presentations, summaries, paper, ...)
1. Link to the Python Notebooks you have finished (you can dump them to PDF)
1. List the tickets from the Scrum backlog that you worked on, linked to deliverables, own experiments, etc.
1. Add any other assignment you feel is evidence of your abilities

I will maintain this structure to keep this portfolio organised and easy to read.


## Courses: 
I will specify which courses I have taken and in cases where the courses were relevant for our project I will add a note to the course. 

### Datacamp: 
We were granted access to a full DataCamp account during this course.
Beforehand a couple of courses and chapters were selected for us to finish.
I was able to finish all the courses on time except for the final two, because of a prioritization for my project.

##### Introduction to Python
Because of my previous experience with Python, this course didn't really add much to my knowledge on Python. 

##### Intermediate Python for Data Science
In this course I have gained experience working with Pandas, which was a great help during the rest of my project. 
This was also my first time working with matplotlib. This helped me to visualize my future findings in data science.

##### Customizing plots
I have continued to expand my knowledge on different ways of visualizing the given Data. 
Because we only received raw email data from our Project owner it was difficult to visualize our data at first. 
After some experimenting I was able to convert the text to values that I was able to plot and that were helpful for the project.
An example of this is the following graph depicting the amount of emails sent per month to the project owner about the noted categories. 
This graph gave us an the project owner a good visual overview of when emails were send and the outliers.

##### Introduction and flat files
For this course we only had to finish the first chapter. This chapter mostly teached me about different ways of reading our files. 
At first we didn't have access to csv file and we had to work with text files for our project. This later changed when we received new exports. 
These exports could be easily imported into a Pandas dataframe. 

##### Writing your own functions
This course was mostly basic knowledge for me as well. It didn't really help me much in the project, because I was already working with functions.


##### Data ingestion & inspection
This chapter mostly helped me understand the basic functionality from Pandas. 
Because I didn't have a lot of experience with Dataframes this course was really helpful to showcase the possibilities.
In our main project we mostly used pandas to store our data in.

##### Exploratory data analysis
This chapter wasn't as helpful as the others. This was because
